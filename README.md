I work on web-based software that includes both back/front-end frameworks. Usually working with Ruby(on Rails) and React framework on both main/side projects. Willing to learn new technologies and implement new workflows with them.

Currently, I am working at Travis CI. So, don't hesitate to ask me about the Travis CI platform, your workflow, and CI/CD methods.
