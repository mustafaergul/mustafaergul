### Hi there, this is Mustafa ðŸ‘‹

I work on web-based software that includes both back/front-end frameworks. Mostly working with Python, Ruby on Rails, and React. I am curious to learn new technologies and implement new workflows with them.

Currently, I am working at Travis CI. So, don't hesitate to ask me about the Travis CI, your CI/CD workflow, and many other :) 

To see my past experiences and you can connect me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mustafaergul/).
